# Electromagnetic-Library (EML)
The EML (Electromagnetic Library) can be imported into Unity applications to simulate the deflection of charged particles in the presence of a non-linear magnetic field. Specifically, this library simulates the deflection of charged particles due to the Lorentz force, around magnetic dipoles.

This is an academic project, created as a part of my fourth year of study at Lancaster University, to complete the MSci Computer Science course.

The repository contains a Unity package to facilitate the import process, as well as the source code.

For more information on this project, please review my dissertation provided in the repository, which covers the project motivation, design, implementation and testing.
